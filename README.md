# Instagram Follower Analysis

The **Instagram Follower Analysis** is a Python script for analyzing your Instagram followers and following lists to identify who is following you but you don't follow back, who you are following but they don't follow back, and who you mutually follow.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x: The programming language used for the scripts.
- BeautifulSoup: A Python library for parsing HTML and XML.
  ```bash
  pip install beautifulsoup4
  ```
- PyAutoGUI: A cross-platform Python module for programmatically controlling the mouse and keyboard.
  ```bash
  pip install pyautogui pynput
  ```
- Keyboard: A Python library for detecting keyboard events and hotkeys.
  ```bash
  pip install keyboard
  ```

Note: It's always a good practice to use a virtual environment for your Python projects to isolate the dependencies. You can use tools like `virtualenv` or `conda` to create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies within it.

## Usage

7. Once the scrolling is complete, open the browser's developer tools and locate the HTML code for the follower or following list.

8. Copy the HTML code and save it in the provided files: `follower.html` for the followers list and `following.html` for the following list.

9. Run the `script.py` script by executing the following command in the terminal:
